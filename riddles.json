        "resolution": "Nestled between craggy cliffs and the relentless tide lies Plaka, a village long abandoned and steeped in haunting tales. Once a thriving community, it fell into decay after being cursed by the arrival of the Leper King, a child exiled to the nearby barren island of Spinalonga due to his disfigurement. Shunned from birth, the child grew bitter in his isolation. As the years passed, he crafted a raft from the bones of the dead and returned to Plaka under the guise of a shipwrecked sailor, concealing his true nature. The villagers, unaware of his affliction, took pity on him, offering shelter and food. Slowly, the disease he carried spread through the village. As the illness ravaged their bodies, the villagers realized too late that they had been deceived. In their despair, they cursed the Leper King, binding his spirit to the village he had destroyed, condemning him to an eternity of suffering. Years later, stories of Plaka's fate became legend, a ghostly tale whispered to frighten children on stormy nights. Drawn by the thrill of the unknown, a group of young travelers ventured into the forsaken village. Under the light of a full moon, they stumbled upon the ancient graveyard, where they discovered a disturbed grave. The earth was freshly turned, and the coffin lid lay askew. Carved into the stone was a chilling inscription: \"O my master, I await thy return, upon the sixtieth year on the day of the greatest moon...\" As they stood there, a gust of wind delivered a blood-stained parchment into their hands. The message, from a doomed adventurer before them, implored for help, revealing that hints to stop the Leper King were hidden throughout the village. It was a plea for salvation, casting the travelers into a desperate quest … Your task begins now. Your objectives are: - Figure out how to stop the Leper King - Avoid getting (all) infected But beware, the Leper King and his servants walk among you, and have left cursed items and traps around… Your starting clue is: Εκεί υπάρχουν Κάτοικοι που δεν έχουν ζωή, αλλά αν δεν τους κρατάς θα φύγουν.
